Sentiment Analysis using BERT

This project implements Sentiment Analysis using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. The goal is to classify text reviews into one of three sentiment classes: negative, neutral, or positive. BERT is a state-of-the-art model for various natural language processing tasks and has been fine-tuned here to perform sentiment classification.
